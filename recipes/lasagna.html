    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This isn't your ordinary lasagna. This recipe creates the most perfect, traditional lasagna you've ever laid your eyes on.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>15oz ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all of the ingredients</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°.</li>
        <li>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles to al dente according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water until noodles are completely cool.</li>
        <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if needed.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by about 1 ½ cups of meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.</li>
